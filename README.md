## Dowloading Technic Launcher and installing modpack

Download and install Technic Launcher if not already installed
then download the 1.12.2 pack (https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/the-1122-pack.1406454).

It's the first option in the search bar if you search for '1.12', once you have found it,
click the install button and wait for it to download.

## Adding Extra Mod

Download the ProjectE .jar file
>https://github.com/SurrealisticRabbit/theBoysServer/blob/main/ProjectE-1.12.2-PE1.4.1.jar

Once the 1.12.2 pack has finished installing, click on **Modpack options**, then change the checkbox
from 'Recommended Version' to **'A Specific Version'** this should be version **1.4.1**, if not change it to 1.4.1.

Click Open - and then locate the 'mods' folder in this directory, then put the ProjectE-1.12.2-PE1.4.1.jar file
here.

You can now close the file explorer and start the modpack, by default the technic launcher only uses 1gb of ram, 
this can be changed in the Launcher Options panel.
